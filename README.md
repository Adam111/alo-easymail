PS: The plugin was 1st released in 2009, then I upgraded it little by little, but now the whole plugin code should be rewritten... But I don't have time to do it now. I'm currently trying to keep the plugin updated and compatible with the latest WordPress versions.

If you use this plugin and to keep it updated please consider the idea of [donating and supporting its development](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=9E6BPXEZVQYHA).
